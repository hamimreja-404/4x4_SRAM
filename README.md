❓What is RAM?

Random Access Memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that stores data temporarily while a computer is running.
It’s called “random access” because the computer can access any part of the memory directly and quickly. 
RAM (Random Access Memory) is very similar to memory in the Human Brain. The human brain’s memory is the 
most essential part played by the brain. Memory helps in remembering things, and people remember their past 
due to the memory present in the brain, similarly, computers have memory too.

❓Types of RAM:

RAM is further divided into two types, SRAM – Static Random Access Memory and DRAM- Dynamic Random Access Memory.

❓What is SRAM?

SRAM is used for Cache memory, it can hold the data as long as the power availability is there. It is refreshed 
simultaneously to store the present information. It is made with CMOS technology. It contains 4 to 6 transistors 
and it also uses clocks. It does not require a periodic refresh cycle due to the presence of transistors.

❓What is DRAM?

DRAM is used for the Main memory, it has a different construction than SRAM, it used one transistor and one capacitor 
(also known as a conductor), which is needed to get recharged in milliseconds due to the presence of the capacitor. Dynamic 
RAM was the first sold memory integrated circuit. DRAM is the second most compact technology in production (First is Flash Memory). 
DRAM has one transistor and one capacitor in 1 memory bit.

🔶Design Overview of a 4x4 SRAM:

A 4x4 SRAM consists of 16 storage cells organized in a 4-word by 4-bit configuration.

🔸Components:

▪️▪️Memory Cells: 16 flip-flop-based storage cells.

▪️▪️Address Lines: 2-bit address input to select one of the four words.

▪️▪️Data Lines: 4-bit bidirectional data bus for reading and writing.

▪️▪️Control Signals:

▪️▪️▪️Write Enable (WE): Enables writing data into the selected memory cell.

▪️▪️▪️Output Enable (OE): Enables reading data from the selected memory cell.
